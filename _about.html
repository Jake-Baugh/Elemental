            <h4>
              Founder/Managing Director
            </h4>
            <p>I set up Elemental to do what traditional telemarketing agencies couldn’t – be a growth partner with
              industry experience that focused on building sales pipelines for clients.

              <br /><br />Business development has been a natural fit for me: I’ve always been empathetic and good with
              prospects. Proof of this came early. I worked for a pan-European full-service marketing agency where I
              generated a pipeline in excess of £2 million in new business every year, from cold call to close. I was
              just 20 years old.

              <br /><br />At Elemental I counsel clients on sales and business development strategy, and then roll my
              sleeves up to support my great team to deliver impressive results for digital health and technology
              companies across the UK and Europe.

            <h3>Vicky Dingle</h3>
            <h4>Head of Data Intelligence</h4>
            <p>I’m responsible for data intelligence at Elemental. This means ensuring that every line of data is not
              only complete, but accurate too – something we take great pride in.

              <br /><br />Attention to detail has always been a bit of an asset of mine, which has certainly helped my
              progression from administrator to heading up a Training and Development department at a financial
              services company.

              <br /><br />I’ve worked at Elemental for 8 years now and have got involved in sorts of projects – lead
              generation, event support, market research, database building and cleaning, in-bound call management –
              and the variety is great. As a person I would describe myself as methodical, dedicated, and calm under
              pressure, resilient, reliable and resourceful.

              and love post-it notes. I have a passion for learning and I’ve enjoyed taking on retention campaigns,
              event organisation, sales acceleration projects, all in my stride.

              <br /><br />I get involved in all areas of account management, including briefing calls, drafting
              campaign documents, briefs and reports, and liaising with clients. My vast and developing experience of
              the healthcare IT market is supported by CQC compliance knowledge from my work as a compliance manager

              <br /><br />I’m a chartered marketer with over 12 years’ marketing and PR experience, almost half of

            <p>As someone who is always looks for opportunities to engage with and connect people in my daily life, it
              made sense for me to do this for a living. I have done so for over 20 years now and sales acceleration
              has been a major part of that.

              <br /><br />At Elemental, I focus on setting appointments and have a strong track record in this area.
              Being methodical, organised, experienced and good with people helps to deliver the results that clients
              really value.

              <br /><br />In my personal life I like projects, I plug into self-development material to keep me sharp

            <h4>Sales Development Specialist</h4>
            <p>My role at Elemental covers much of the sales acceleration process – from data intelligence to closing
              appointments. I take responsibility for building databases that are integral to successfully marketing
              relevant products or services or generating leads or appointments for our clients.

              <br /><br />I also hit the phones and manage emails to convert leads to appointments, which is very
              satisfying part of the job. Every lead generation plan we write is different so there is a lot of variety
              in the type of audiences we engage with on a daily basis.

              <br /><br />From an early age I realised my passion lied in the early stages of the sales; getting a
              consumer’s attention and turning that interest into a solid lead for a client. This has led to over a
              decade of sales and account management experience across accountancy, manufacturing, recruitment and most
              recently, health technology sectors.

              all aspects of this area including scheduling, customer liaison, scoping, project management, training
              and much, much more. This is a natural fit for me as I have a strong background in technical operations
              and call centre management.

              <br /><br />My career highlight is managing the build and implementation of a UK accredited security
